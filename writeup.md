## BEV Map Visualization
We can observe hear the roof for all cars looks similar
![](output/pcl_1.png)
Wonderfully, the point cloud is able to identify the narrow route
![](output/pcl_2.png)
Here we can see the tiers are visible enough, we can help identify the cars easily
![](output/pcl_3.png)
Windsheilds are not lidar reflective, which is a unique feature for cars
![](output/pcl_4.png)
Pedestrians can be identified easily as well
![](output/pcl_5.png)
Cones are a bit ambigious and hard to predict what it is without supplement information from camera images

Cones from different perspective

Wheels and lower part of cars (back-bumper) are unique, it's a bit blurry
![](output/pcl_8.png)
Viewing the cars from down to top show some empty spaces within the cars

Windsheilds are non-reflective

## Range & Intensity Images

Windsheild, taillamps, and license plate are light reflective. There're some random reflective objects but they are non consistent across the terms
so it can be eliminated somehow
